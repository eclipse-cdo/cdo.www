Do you like to model and generate your applications with the <em>Eclipse Modeling Framework</em> (EMF)?
That's fine because EMF is really great at generating model based runtimes, user interfaces and XML serialization!
<p>

But what if:
<p>

<ul>
<li>you require more enterprise-like model persistence than XML serialization?
<li>your application has to be available for multiple users at the same time?
<li>your model resources are too huge to fit into XML files?
<li>you need object grained locking and transactions that span multiple resources?
<li>your users appreciate to always look at the latest state of the central model?
<li>they could simply switch back their view of the model to historical states?
</ul>

The CDO model repository and distributed shared model for EMF 
delivers solutions to the afore mentioned challenges and more. 
CDO is a component of the Modeling project for many years now 
and the latest generation has a completely new design and a 
whole bunch of cool new features. 
<p>

This symposium talk provides you with an introductory overview of the 
rationale behind the CDO technology. That includes a review of the 
requirements as well as explanations of the major design concepts.
The focus of this talk is on the functional aspects 
that adopters need to be aware of, the CDO client-side integration 
with EMF in particular. A short overview of the CDO server-side
concepts rounds up the big picture.
<p>

You will be able to easily learn even the more complicated details by 
settling back and watching the various animations that accompany this talk!
Those of you attracted by this high-level introduction are invited to
deepen their understanding in a follow-up talk with even more 
background and coding examples:
